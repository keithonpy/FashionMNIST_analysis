# Fashion image analysis
This repository analyse the FashionMNIST dataset from `torchvision.dataset`. 

The dataset contains 6,000 train data and 1,0000 test data of fashion image and labels. 

Three models were trained for the classification of the fashion image
1. `model 0`: Neural network with linear hidden layers
2. `model 1`: Neural network with non-linear hidden layers
3. `model 2`: Convolution Neural network with layers reference to TinyVGG
